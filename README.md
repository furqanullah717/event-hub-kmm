- **Event Registration:** Register for events you're interested in.
- **Cross-Platform:** Built with Kotlin Multiplatform, allowing the app to run on Android, iOS, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `androidApp`: Android-specific code and UI.
- `iosApp`: iOS-specific code and UI (Swift/Kotlin Multiplatform).
- `shared`: Shared Kotlin code.
- `data`: Data layer, including event data and repositories.
- `presentation`: Presentation layer, including view models and UI logic.
- `resources`: Shared resources like images, fonts, and strings.
